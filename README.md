# Titanic Machine Learning project
Titanic project notebook
This project leverages the titanic dataset to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers 
based on several features such as age,gender,class etc.
This notebook explores the dataset, visualizes key concepts,perform data processing,  train machine learning models
and evaluate model performance.
